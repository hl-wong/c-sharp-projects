## What I Learned

- What is MVC?<br>
M = Models - A class represent the data of the app.<br>
V = Views - A component to display the user interface of the app.
C = Controllers - A class that handle browser requests (localhost:PORT/Controller/Action), retrieve model data, and call view templates.<br>
